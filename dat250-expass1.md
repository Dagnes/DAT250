# DAT250: Software Technology Experiment Assignment 1

Through the assignment I met some problems when I installed jdk and maven, but other than that the assignment went relatively smooth.

For the jdk problem the installer got stuck for no apparent reason so a quick restart of the computer and the jdk install went smoothly.To check that the jdk was installed and worked I simply created a hello world project with the intellij IDE to check if it could compile and run, which it did.

And for the maven installation I got some problems with the environment variables. For some reason after i set the environment variables the terminal did not find maven so i could not verify the installation. After a while it seems just a quick restart of the computer after the environment varibles was set seemed to have worked. After the restart i simply went into the terminal and used the command: "mvn --version" to verify the installation and it worked.
